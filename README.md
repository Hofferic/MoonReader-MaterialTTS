# MoonReader-MaterialTTS
XPosed Module to make some visual updates to the TTS functionality of Moon+ Reader.

You are free to use and change any of the code in this project not marked otherwise, little that there is of it.

Used resources:

XPosed is given to the Android community courtesy of rovo89, more info on xposed.info

Icons used in this module are taken from materialdesignicons.com wich was created by Austin Andrews

The main app icon is extracted from Moon+ Reader and may be changed at a future point to avoid copyright problems
The repo also contains some disassembled layout files which have been changed to reflect the changes made by this module for ease of reference. None of them are neccessary and they may be omitted in the future, same as the main icon.
